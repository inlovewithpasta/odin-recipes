        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            They’re infused with warm flavors.
            They’re moist and soft, making it difficult to eat just one.
            A batch comes together in under 30 minutes, so you can bake them the morning of Sunday brunch or as an easy meal-prep recipe.
            And the really nice part? The recipe lends itself well to customization, so you can mix in tasty add-ins like ripe fruit or creamy chocolate chips.
